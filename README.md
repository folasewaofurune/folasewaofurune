## Hi there 👋

My name is Sewa, a technology passionate student who enjoys exploring digital solutions. I have particular interest in the field of cybersecurity but am open to exploring other areas in technology where I can contribute and continue learning.
I enjoy problem solving, collaborating with others and taking on new challenges. I am eager to apply and exercise the skills I have developed throughout my academic career while gaining new skills.
